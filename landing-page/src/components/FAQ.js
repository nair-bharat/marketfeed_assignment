                We completely understand your feelings. Even we had the same questions in mind when we started out and saw
                many “stock market gurus” in our journey. Please make sure that you ask for and see the Profit and Loss report of whoever you are learning trading from. With that being said, we will be showing our P&L statements when you join
                the programme. What is more interesting is Sharique Samsudheen has made his P&L public on social media.
